InfiBowling
===========
These are implementations of Uncle Bob Martin's classic bowling TDD sample from the book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices".

We ran a dojo at our company to get some of our people started with TDD, and used this sample problem as the case. Included projects is the result of one morning of experimentation.
